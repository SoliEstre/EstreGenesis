# A2A PR System — Cross-repo Pull Request orchestration via the A2A messaging layer (RRP v0.3 DRAFT)

> **DRAFT v0.3 — Phase 1 + Phase 1b shipped, AC-dogfood-6 achieved via PR #1.**
> Phase 1 prototype (Level 2 — provider-mediated Github PR path) shipped upstream as commit `2213a14`. Phase 1b (Level 1 — A2A-envelope-only path on the receiving-side bridge) shipped subsequently; the first Level 1 protocol-mediated PR completed end-to-end as the §10 dogfood case, landing the §13.14/§13.15 mirror at integration-branch commit `140fd64` on the target repo. Three structural defects (sourceContentRef `kind` placeholder lookup; missing `inline-section-mirror` handler; `targetPath` base ambiguity) were surfaced and resolved by the dry-run + review + `abs+exists` gates BEFORE any external publish — the gate stack's value is empirically validated. Priority open questions Q1/Q2/Q3 are resolved by the Phase 1 ship; AC-dogfood-6 is achieved by Phase 1b + the PR #1 e2e completion. See §11 + §10A (case study).
> EG 1차지식 perspective (Constellation orchestration domain, downstream-of-main per §13.9 peer role).
> **Still NOT a unilateral spec** — the v0.3 additions (7 RRP-body learnings from dogfood PR #1: `sourceContentRef.kind` enum, `inline-section-mirror` semantics, `targetPath` base spec, cherry-pick skip discipline, dry-run `abs+exists` verification, `trusted_mirrors` `targetRepo` alias resolve order, `PR_LIVE` env semantics + `dryRun` marker + user merge delegation) layer on top of the Phase 1 / Phase 1b form and remain open to refinement at joint formalization. Items marked "(open for main review)" continue to be load-bearing.
> Targeted as a new sub-section in `Constellation.md` (proposed slot: §13.22, immediately after §13.21 fresh-context-defer; number to be confirmed at joint-formalization time).

## 1. Status & provenance

- **Version**: v0.3 DRAFT (Phase 1 + Phase 1b shipped; AC-dogfood-6 achieved via PR #1 e2e completion at integration-branch commit `140fd64`). Predecessors: v0.2 (Phase 1 ship + Level 1 abstraction layered, 2026-06-01); v0.1 (initial RRP, 2026-06-01).
- **Date**: 2026-06-01 (v0.3 patch same day as v0.1 + v0.2 cuts; reflects Phase 1 + Phase 1b ship + dogfood PR #1 e2e completion arriving same day).
- **Context**: Companion to the §13.14 / §13.15 mirror gap (these two sections currently exist in this repo's `Constellation.md` but are NOT mirrored in the `<hub-repo>` `WS-PROTOCOL.md` — the manual-PR tax described in §1 below is the immediate driver, and the same §13.14/§13.15 mirror PR is the canonical dogfood case described in §9).
- **Authoring lane**: EG (per §13.9 peer/upstream role with respect to the `<hub-repo>` main; this RRP is one half of a coordinated proposal — the other half is whatever the `<hub-repo>` main wants to add at joint formalization time).
- **Joint-formalization workflow**: this draft → main upstream review (`<hub-repo>` side; comments via outbox `Delegate` or live-board `decisions` panel per §13.17) → reconciled merge → committed as new `§13.22` (or whichever number main assigns) in `Constellation.md`. The dogfood PR (§9) is the *forcing function*: landing the §13.22 protocol allows the §13.14/§13.15 mirror PR itself to be the first PR routed through the new system, proving the protocol works at the moment it lands.
- **Sensitivity**: every concrete design decision in §3–§8 is marked "(open for main review)". The §9 open questions enumerate the specific decisions where main's reaction is most load-bearing.
- **Redaction discipline (§13.14)**: this document uses `<hub-repo>` / `<main-prod>` placeholders for the user's private production hub. The EG repo (`SoliEstre/EstreGenesis`) is named explicitly because it is public-shipped. No real production org/repo paths appear inline.

## 2. Problem statement

### 2.1 The manual-PR tax

Constellation evolves at v2.4.x cadence with sub-day patches (the recent §13.13~§13.21 chain landed across ~3 days, with multiple §13.x sub-section additions per day at peak). Each spec update that is *load-bearing on the cross-repo wire vocabulary* (e.g., §13.13 ack layer, §13.14 redaction discipline, §13.15 build-time gate, §13.19 deadlock resolution, §13.20 blocker tracking) needs to be mirrored to the `<hub-repo>`'s `WS-PROTOCOL.md` for the downstream readers to see the same contract the upstream is shipping. Today, the *only* path for that mirror is:

1. EG-side agent drafts the mirror body (content already reviewed in EG repo, distilled-to-public per §13.14 redaction gate, syntax-gated per §13.15).
2. Outbox `Delegate` push to main carrying the mirror payload (the *content* is delivered via A2A).
3. **USER manually creates the PR in the `<hub-repo>`** — opens the GitHub UI, copies the body, picks the target branch, adds labels/reviewers, opens the PR.
4. USER (or main agent on hub side) reviews + merges.

Step 3 is the coordination tax this RRP exists to eliminate. The tax is small per-event but scales linearly with the number of cross-repo spec parity events. At current Constellation cadence (~2-5 spec updates per day, of which ~1-2 need cross-repo mirroring), that is 5-10 manual PR creations per week sitting on the user's plate — a recurring chore whose cost is *attention*, not just clicks. The §13.20 blocker-tracking discipline catches *external work that does not progress*, but it does not address *the manual step in the middle of an otherwise-automated pipeline* that this section names.

### 2.2 The §13.14 / §13.15 parity gap (the immediate use case)

Concretely, as of 2026-06-01:

- `Constellation.md §13.14` (env-token redaction discipline before public ship) is present in this repo. The `<hub-repo>`'s `WS-PROTOCOL.md` does **not** carry an equivalent section. Downstream adopters of the hub spec who do not also read EG `Constellation.md` miss this discipline.
- `Constellation.md §13.15` (reference-build syntax gate; `node --check` pre-commit + CI) is present in this repo. The `<hub-repo>`'s `WS-PROTOCOL.md` does **not** carry an equivalent section. Same gap.

Both sections were authored EG-side in response to real upstream-shipped incidents (a JSDoc syntax trap in a v2.2.x reference; a quoted-token meta-grep leak in a NOTES file). They are *load-bearing on downstream safety*: skipping §13.14 risks env-token leaks; skipping §13.15 risks loading-broken reference builds. The mirror is therefore not a nice-to-have — it is a parity-of-safety-discipline gap, and it has been pending across multiple Constellation versions because step 3 of §2.1 has not been performed.

The shape of the §13.14/§13.15 mirror PR — content already reviewed EG-side, target `<hub-repo>` `WS-PROTOCOL.md`, scope a single doc file — is **also** the canonical shape for *most* future cross-repo spec mirror PRs. Solving it generally (this RRP's §3-§8) is the same as solving the §13.14/§13.15 case specifically; the §9 dogfood plan is therefore not an exemplar of the system, it *is* the system's first production use.

### 2.3 Why a protocol, not just a script

A naive alternative — "write a `gh pr create` wrapper, call it from a TodoWrite task" — does not address the problem this RRP is scoped to:

- The wrapper would have to be triggered manually by the user or by the EG agent's foreground turn; the A2A layer would not see the PR lifecycle, the live board would not surface PR state alongside other agent state, and §13.13 ack discipline would not apply (a PR is an *application-tier* artifact; treating it as opaque external state outside the protocol re-introduces the silent-stall failure mode §13.20 exists to prevent).
- A wrapper has no answer for *cross-repo* coordination — when the PR target is `<hub-repo>` and the requester is the EG agent, the wrapper has to live somewhere with credentials to *both* repos, has to surface its state somewhere the user can observe, and has to integrate with the orchestration tree (§13.9) for review authority. None of these is a wrapper concern; all of them are protocol concerns.
- The §13.19 deadlock and §13.20 blocker-tracking sections already cover *internal* coordination friction; a PR that sits unreviewed in a foreign repo is the cross-repo instance of the same friction. Building this RRP's protocol within the §13.x family allows the existing deadlock / blocker primitives to compose over PR lifecycle (see §8.4 below).

The RRP therefore proposes a **wire vocabulary + agent topology + state machine** treatment, not a script.

### 2.4 Two-level abstraction — Level 1 (virtual PR, A2A-only) vs Level 2 (Github PR, provider-mediated)

A core v0.2 refinement: the same wire vocabulary (§4) and state machine (§9) describe two distinct physical realizations of a "PR." Which one applies in a given case is a function of *who operates the source and target sides* and *what file-system access the receiving side holds*.

**Level 1 — Virtual PR (A2A-only path)**. The PR exists *only* as an A2A message exchange between the source agent and the target-owner agent; no actual provider-side (GitHub / GitLab / Gitea) PR object is created. Applicable when:

- Source and target sides share an operator (same person or team operates both ends), AND
- Both sides have direct repo-level file-system access (the receiving side can clone, edit, commit, and push to the target repo locally).

In Level 1, the receiving side (= the side that holds commit-push authority on the target repo) reads the `sourceContentRef` carried by `PRRequest`, applies the change directly to its local checkout of the target repo, commits, and pushes — using A2A envelopes only for review / ack signaling. The `gh pr create` step is skipped entirely. Review happens in-band on the A2A wire; merge equals "commit to the target repo's integration branch and push."

**Level 2 — Github PR (provider-mediated path)**. The existing Phase 1 form per ship `2213a14`. `handlePrRequest` calls `gh pr create` against the target repo provider; the PR exists as a real GitHub / GitLab / Gitea object; review and merge flow through the provider's UI / API, with A2A envelopes mirroring state. Applicable when:

- Source and target sides are operated by different parties, OR
- The PR is cross-org, OR
- The target repo's integration policy requires a provider-side PR object (e.g., for required-status-checks, for audit trail at the provider tier, for compatibility with downstream Constellation adopters' provider-mediated workflows).

**Selection rule** (also encoded in the permission table §8 and reflected in §6 approval discipline). If `category == "trusted_mirror"` AND `operator-shares-target` AND `target-repo-direct-access` conditions both hold, **Level 1 is the default**. Otherwise Level 2. The selection is carried as an explicit payload field `level: 1 | 2` on `PRRequest`; the receiving side validates against its capability matrix and rejects mismatches (e.g., if `level == 1` is requested but the receiver has no direct push authority on the target repo, the receiver rejects with a capability-mismatch reason and the sender may retry with `level: 2`).

**Backward compatibility**: `PRRequest.level` defaults to `2` if absent, matching the Phase 1 ship's existing behavior. Pre-v0.2 senders continue to function unchanged.

**Wire vocabulary across both levels** — the five `CUSTOM` types from §4 (`PRRequest` / `PRDraftReady` / `PRReviewAck` / `PRMergeRequest`+`PRMergeAck` / `PRStatusUpdate`) cover *both* levels; semantics adapt per level. Per-type adaptations are documented inline at each type in §4, summarized here:

| Type | Level 1 (virtual PR) | Level 2 (Github PR) |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `PRRequest.level` | `1` | `2` (default if absent) |
| `PRDraftReady.draftRef` | commit-sha on the staged target branch | provider PR number |
| `PRMergeRequest` | "commit the staged change to the target's integration branch" | "call `gh pr merge`" |
| `PRMergeAck` | reports commit SHA + push success | reports merged-PR state per provider |
| `PRStatusUpdate.state` | level-1 state machine (DRAFT → IN_REVIEW → APPROVED / CHANGES_REQUESTED → MERGED, where MERGED ≡ commit pushed to integration branch) | level-2 state machine (the §9 5-state machine as originally specified) |

The §9 state machine is `level`-discriminated; both levels traverse the same 5 logical states, but the transition triggers and the MERGED-state realization differ per level.

**Phase 1 ship status**: the current Phase 1 prototype (`2213a14`) implements Level 2 only. Phase 1b (§13) extends to Level 1.

## 3. Goals & non-goals

### 3.1 Goals

- **G1**. Eliminate the user's manual step in the cross-repo spec mirror loop for *trusted-category* PRs (defined in §5).
- **G2**. Surface the full PR lifecycle (draft → open → review → approved/merged) as A2A wire vocabulary, so the live board and §13.13 ack discipline can see and react to PR state.
- **G3**. Compose cleanly with existing §13.x discipline: §13.9 (peer / authority roles), §13.13 (ack layer), §13.17 (decisions panel), §13.19 (deadlock resolution), §13.20 (blocker tracking). Reuse existing vocabulary where the PR lifecycle maps onto it (the §8 state machine reuses §13.19's `ReviewSLAAck` and §13.20's `BlockerNudge` for review-pending states).
- **G4**. Keep the *authority surface* tight — only main-role agents on the target repo may `PRMergeRequest`; the autonomous-execution principle's external-publish gate remains for any non-trusted-category PR.
- **G5**. Dogfood: the §13.14 / §13.15 mirror PR (§9) is the FIRST PR routed through the new system, landing immediately after §13.22 lands. No "wait for a future use case to validate" — the validation IS the landing event.

### 3.2 Non-goals

- **NG1**. This RRP does NOT propose CI/CD automation, automated merging on green checks, or any policy that lands code without a human (or main-role agent) in the loop. The autonomous-execution principle's gates (a) loss, (b) external publish, (c) catastrophic action — apply unchanged; this RRP supplies the *mechanism* for some PR categories to bypass manual user intervention, not the *policy* for what merges autonomously.
- **NG2**. This RRP does NOT propose a general-purpose GitHub/GitLab integration layer. The scope is "PRs between repos in the Constellation deployment" — specifically EG ↔ `<hub-repo>`, and any other repo pair where both sides have an A2A peer presence. PRs to truly third-party repos (e.g., an upstream OSS dependency) remain manual.
- **NG3**. This RRP does NOT change the §13.13 ack vocabulary, the §13.9 role model, or the §13.11 board-emission discipline. The new vocabulary in §4 sits **on top of** those layers; it does not modify them.
- **NG4**. This RRP does NOT propose a credential-management subsystem (key rotation, OIDC integration, etc.). It assumes whichever topology (§5) is adopted has access to credentials by some means external to this protocol — either the user's local `gh` CLI (topology b) or a deployment-time configured token store (topology a). The protocol carries no credentials on the wire.
- **NG5**. This RRP does NOT cover PR-review *content* generation (e.g., automated review comments from an LLM). Review is performed by an agent at the human's direction (or by the human directly via the board); the protocol carries the review *envelope* (the `PRReviewAck` ack), not the review *body*.

---

## 4. Wire vocabulary — proposed new `CUSTOM` message types

Five new `CUSTOM` types are proposed, all layered above §13.13 (server-stamped `msgId`, server-emitted `Ack{delivered}`, recipient-agent `AckProcessed`). All are application-tier emissions per §13.13's three-grade model — none are server-auto-emitted; all originate from an agent at the application layer. **All five types apply to both Level 1 and Level 2** (§2.4); per-type fields with level-discriminated semantics are flagged inline below.

| Name | Direction | Purpose | Required fields | Optional fields |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `PRRequest` | Any agent → PR-bot agent OR direct to repo-owner agent | Initiate a new PR | `sourceRepo`, `sourceContentRef` (branch ref OR inline filesDiff), `targetRepo`, `targetBranch`, `title`, `body`, `level: 1 \| 2` (default `2`) | `labels[]`, `reviewers[]`, `category: 'trusted-mirror' \| 'standard' \| 'emergency'`, `slaEta` |
| `PRDraftReady` | PR-bot agent (Level 2) OR receiving-side agent (Level 1) → requester | Acknowledge PR creation OR target-branch staging; carry draftRef | `for: msgId`, `draftRef` (commit-sha for Level 1; pr-number for Level 2), `checksPending[]` | `prUrl` (Level 2), `repoOwner`, `repoName`, `headBranch` |
| `PRReviewAck` | Reviewer-role agent → requester | Application-tier review ack (approve / request-changes / comment) | `for: draftRef`, `verdict: 'approve' \| 'request-changes' \| 'comment'`, `reviewBody` | `inlineComments[]`, `slaEta` (if `request-changes`), `reviewedAt` |
| `PRMergeRequest` / `PRMergeAck` | Merge-authority agent → PR-bot / receiving-side agent; back to requester | Trigger and confirm merge | `for: draftRef`, `mergeStrategy: 'merge' \| 'squash' \| 'rebase'` (Level 2 only — Level 1 always equivalent to fast-forward / direct commit to integration branch) | `commitTitle`, `commitBody`, `deleteSourceBranch: bool` |
| `PRStatusUpdate` | PR-bot agent OR receiving-side agent → all watchers (broadcast or targeted) | Periodic state push | `draftRef`, `level`, `state: 'draft' \| 'open' \| 'changes_requested' \| 'approved' \| 'merged' \| 'closed'`, `checks: {...}` (Level 2 only), `reviewState: {...}` | `lastEventAt`, `nextSlaCheckAt` |

### 4.1 `PRRequest`

The sender is any agent that has determined a PR is the appropriate next step. The target is either:

- A dedicated **PR-bot agent** (topology a in §5) — the bot holds provider credentials and creates the real PR on the provider's API surface, OR
- A **repo-owner agent** that delegates to the local bridge's `createPR` port (topology b in §5, the form adopted by Phase 1 ship `2213a14`).

The `category` field is the *trusted-mirror* gate from §6: `trusted-mirror` PRs are auto-approved for creation per the deployment policy in `state.json.pr_system.trusted_mirrors` (§13.14/§13.15 pair as shipped); `standard` PRs follow per-PR user opt-in; `emergency` PRs (e.g., a hotfix mirror) carry an out-of-band approval reference.

**`level` field** (v0.2 addition; default `2` for backward compatibility with Phase 1 ship). `1` selects the Level 1 virtual-PR path (A2A-envelope-only; receiving side commits + pushes directly to the integration branch; no `gh pr create`); `2` selects the Level 2 Github-PR path (provider-mediated; `gh pr create` against the target repo). The receiving side validates the requested level against its capability matrix (does it hold direct push access to `targetRepo`? does it share an operator with the sender?) and rejects mismatches; the sender may retry with the other level.

The `sourceContentRef` field carries either a branch ref (per §7 option β / β′ — the standard form) or an inline `filesDiff` for small diffs (§7 option α) or an inline-section-mirror payload (v0.3 addition; see §4.1.1 enum and §6.5 semantics). The `slaEta` field is the requester's *expected review SLA*, composing with §13.19.7 `ReviewSLAAck` discipline — if the reviewer cannot meet the ETA, the existing renegotiate-SLA path applies.

### 4.1.1 `sourceContentRef.kind` enum (v0.3 formalization)

The `sourceContentRef` object carries a discriminator field `kind` whose value selects the content-sourcing handler the receiving bridge invokes. Three values are defined; the enum is closed (receivers MUST reject unknown values per the fail-safe rule below).

| `kind` value | Payload shape | Receiver handler |
|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| `branch-ref` | `{ kind: 'branch-ref', sourceRepo, sourceBranch }` | `git fetch <sourceRepo> <sourceBranch>` + `git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- .` against the receiving side's checkout of the target repo. The original branch-based form per §7.β / §7.β′. |
| `inline-files-diff` | `{ kind: 'inline-files-diff', filesDiff }` where `filesDiff` is a unified-diff string | `git apply <filesDiff>` against the receiving side's checkout of the target repo. Inline diff form per §7.α. |
| `inline-section-mirror` | `{ kind: 'inline-section-mirror', body, targetPath, mergeStrategy }` (see §6.5 for full semantics) | Append (or per `mergeStrategy`) the literal `body` text to the file at `targetPath`, then `git add <targetPath>` ONLY (never `-A`) and commit. NO branch-fetch step. New in v0.3 — solves the §10A dogfood-1 case study's "would have committed the entire EG repo into hub main" near-disaster. |

**Fail-safe default for unknown `kind`** (v0.3 invariant — derived from §10A dogfood-1 defect #2): if the receiving bridge does not recognize the `kind` value, it MUST reject the `PRRequest` with a `PRRequestRejected { reason: 'unknown-source-content-kind', kind: <received-value> }` envelope. The receiver MUST NOT fall through to a default handler. The dogfood-1 case showed why: an unrecognized `kind` falling through to the `branch-ref` handler caused `git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- .` to attempt a wholesale repository overwrite of the target repo. The fail-safe reject keeps the receiving bridge in a safe (no-op) state until the sender corrects the payload.

### 4.2 `PRDraftReady`

In **Level 2**, the PR-bot agent's commit ack that the PR has been created on the provider. `draftRef` carries the provider PR number; `prUrl` carries the provider URL for human follow-through; `checksPending[]` carries the initial CI / required-status-checks set the PR must wait on before review is meaningful.

In **Level 1**, the receiving-side agent's commit ack that the source content has been applied to a staged target branch (typically a local branch on the receiving side's checkout, not yet pushed to the integration branch). `draftRef` carries the commit SHA of the staged commit; `prUrl` is absent; `checksPending[]` is absent (Level 1 has no provider-side CI by construction; if the receiving side runs local pre-commit checks, those are flagged as `localChecks[]` instead).

This is **NOT** a §13.13 `AckProcessed` — it is a richer application-tier ack that confirms the PR (in either level's sense) exists AND surfaces the data the rest of the lifecycle depends on. (Open for main review: should this be modeled as `AckProcessed` with a structured `summary`, or as a distinct type? The proposal here is a distinct type because the data shape diverges enough that conflation would force every consumer of `AckProcessed` to handle a special case.)

### 4.3 `PRReviewAck` (layered above §13.13 ack discipline)

This is the critical type for the §9 dogfood case. The reviewer (typically the `<hub-repo>` main-role agent, or a designated reviewer per the §13.20 manifest) emits this on review completion. The three-grade `verdict` matches GitHub's review verdicts (`approve` / `request-changes` / `comment`); the `inlineComments[]` array carries line-level comments mapped to file + position; the optional `slaEta` on `request-changes` re-arms the §13.20 blocker cadence pointing at the requester (the requester now owes a follow-up commit on the PR branch within the stated SLA).

**Layering above §13.13** (open for main review): the proposal is that `PRReviewAck` IS the §13.13 `AckProcessed` for the `PRRequest` — a single application-tier ack carries both the "processed" semantics and the review verdict. Alternative: emit `AckProcessed` first (on PR-bot inbound parse) and `PRReviewAck` second (on actual review completion); this preserves the §13.13 transport-vs-commitment-vs-completion three-ack stratification cleanly. The two-ack alternative is cleaner taxonomically but doubles wire traffic; the single-ack proposal is leaner but conflates two layers. Recommended for v0.1: **two-ack alternative** — `AckProcessed` from the PR-bot when the request is parsed and PR creation is queued, then `PRReviewAck` from the reviewer when review actually completes. Main upstream review may steer this differently.

### 4.4 `PRMergeRequest` / `PRMergeAck` (authority gated; strict gate confirmed by Phase 1 ship)

Per §13.20-style authority discipline, only an agent with `role == main` for the target repo may emit `PRMergeRequest`. The receiving side's response is `PRMergeAck` carrying the merge result.

**Level 2**: the PR-bot agent (or local-bridge per topology b) invokes `gh pr merge` against the provider; `PRMergeAck` reports the provider's merged-PR state (success / blocked-by-failing-check / blocked-by-conflict). The `mergeStrategy` field (`merge` / `squash` / `rebase`) defaults to `squash` for mirror PRs (single-commit history is cleaner for spec mirror diff readability); deployment may override per-target-repo policy.

**Level 1**: the receiving side commits the staged change (referenced by the `for: draftRef` commit SHA) to the target repo's integration branch (typically `main` / default branch) and pushes. `PRMergeAck` reports the resulting commit SHA on the integration branch + push success. `mergeStrategy` is ignored for Level 1 (the operation is conceptually a fast-forward / direct apply); if multiple commits were staged, the receiving side may squash or replay per local policy, but the wire envelope reports only the final integration-branch commit SHA.

**Authority gate**: the **strict gate** (only `role == main` on the target repo may emit `PRMergeRequest`) is confirmed adopted by Phase 1 ship `2213a14` — the server's `wsPrMergeReject` path rejects emissions from non-`main` roles with a logged `decisions` panel entry. This is independent of provider ACL drift; the protocol's authority chain is deterministic and does not delegate to external ACL state. The strict reading composes cleanly with §13.9's role-coordination tree.

### 4.5 `PRStatusUpdate`

Periodic state push from the PR-bot to all watchers. Cadence parallels §13.20.4's `BlockerNudge` cadence — once per agent-active-corrected rearm cycle, or on event (a new commit, a new review, a CI status flip). This is the data feeding the live-board PR panel (open for main review: §8.4 below proposes the panel; the implementation is a separate `app.js`/`server.cjs`/`style.css` ask).

The broadcast-vs-targeted decision is per-PR: a `trusted-mirror` PR's status pushes broadcast (so all interested agents see the lifecycle); a `standard` PR's status pushes targeted to the requester + reviewer only (per §13.11 board-emission economy — only the relevant agents).

---

## 5. Agent topology — three options, recommendation

The PR-bot role can be realized in three ways. The trade-off is between *credential isolation*, *implementation complexity*, and *coupling to the user's local environment*.

### 5.a Dedicated A2A agent (topology a)

A long-running agent (e.g., `agentId: pr-bot`) that holds GitHub/GitLab/Gitea credentials (token-store or OIDC), hears `PRRequest` messages on the A2A wire, and creates real PRs via the provider API. Same shape as any other Constellation agent — same §13.13 ack discipline, same §13.11 board emission, same §13.9 role classification (proposed: `role: worker` per the §13.9 worker-pattern, since the PR-bot's lane is bounded to PR-lifecycle ops and it takes `Delegate` from main-role agents).

**Trade-offs**:

- **Pros**: clean separation; no special privileges in the user's local env; can be deployed once and serve multiple requester agents; credentials are isolated to one agent's lane; auditable (every PR ops emission goes through the A2A wire and is recorded in `ws-history`).
- **Cons**: needs a credential store (token rotation, secret-management hygiene); needs a deployment surface (a hosted process, or a long-running local one); duplicates auth that the user already has in their local `gh` CLI; the user has to commission and maintain the agent.

### 5.b Local-bridge command (topology b)

Extend `local-bridge.eux` with a `cmd: createPR(spec)` port. The local bridge runs in the user's IDE alongside their `gh`/`git` CLI authentication — no separate credentials, reuses what the user already has.

The shape (open for main review):

```text
agent emits: PRRequest { ... }
       ↓ (A2A to local-bridge)
local-bridge invokes: gh pr create --base <targetBranch> --head <sourceBranch> --title <...> --body <...>
       ↓ (provider API call)
local-bridge emits: PRDraftReady { prUrl, prNumber, ... }
       ↓ (A2A back to requester)
```

**Trade-offs**:

- **Pros**: no separate credentials; no separate process; reuses the user's existing `gh` CLI auth (which the user has already accepted the trust posture of); simplest possible impl (one new bridge command, one provider CLI invocation); composes naturally with the existing bridge's emission discipline.
- **Cons**: requires the user's local bridge to be running (no cross-machine PR creation); ties PR creation to the local-bridge process lifecycle (if the bridge is down, PR creation is too); the bridge process holds *additional* authority (it can now create PRs on the user's behalf, expanding the bridge's blast radius — relevant to §13.16 lockfile / single-instance discipline).

### 5.c Hybrid (topology c)

Dedicated PR-bot for cross-repo paths where credentials must be explicit (e.g., a `<hub-repo>` ↔ `<main-prod>` PR where neither side is in the user's local env); local-bridge `createPR` for same-org / same-user-auth repos where the user is already authenticated locally.

**Trade-offs**:

- **Pros**: each path uses the simplest surface for its credential profile; the policy of which path to use is per-deployment.
- **Cons**: two implementations to maintain; the requester has to know which path to address (which the §4.1 `PRRequest` target field implicitly carries, but the user has to configure correctly); the protocol surface area is wider.

### 5.d Recommendation — topology b adopted by Phase 1 ship

**Topology b (local-bridge command) is adopted** by Phase 1 ship `2213a14`. The local-bridge runs in the operator's IDE process and uses the operator's `gh` CLI authentication; no separate credential store is required for v0.1 / Phase 1 / Phase 1b scope. Topology a / c remain as phase-2/3 expansions per §13 migration plan when cross-machine or separate-identity requirements appear.

Rationale (retained from v0.1; confirmed by Phase 1 ship):

- The §10 dogfood case (EG → `<hub-repo>`) uses the user's local `gh` CLI authentication directly — the user has `gh` auth for both repos, no separate credential plumbing is needed. Topology b lands in one bridge change (the Phase 1 `handlePrRequest` + `handlePrMergeRequest` handlers).
- Topology a's credential-store requirements (rotation, secret hygiene, leak-grep per §13.14) are non-trivial; deferring them lets §13.22 ship without dragging in a credential-management RRP.
- Topology c is a natural superset of b — adding a separate PR-bot agent for cross-machine paths is additive, not a re-architecture.

**Level 1 fit**: topology b is *also* the natural home for Level 1 (§2.4). The local-bridge already holds direct repo-level file-system access on both source and target sides (when they share an operator); Level 1's "receiving side commits + pushes directly" path is one additional `handlePrRequest` branch (`if request.level === 1 → apply diff to target checkout, commit, push, emit PRDraftReady{draftRef: commitSha}` ) on top of the existing Level 2 handler. Phase 1b (§13) adds this branch.

## 6. Approval discipline — trusted-mirror category + per-PR opt-in default

The autonomous-execution principle's gate (b) external-publish is the canonical reference: a PR to an *external repo* (any repo other than the current one the agent is operating in) is an external publish, and external publish requires user opt-in *unless* a pre-authorized policy specifies otherwise.

This RRP proposes three PR categories with different opt-in profiles:

### 6.1 `trusted-mirror` (pre-authorized policy)

A spec-mirror PR between two repos where the diff content is *already reviewed in the source repo* and the target is *the deterministic mirror surface* (a specific file in a specific repo). Example: EG `Constellation.md §13.14/§13.15` → `<hub-repo>` `WS-PROTOCOL.md` new section.

The pre-authorization lives in `state.json` (or a per-deployment policy file) as a list of source→target pairings:

```jsonc
{
  "pr_system": {
    "trusted_mirrors": [
      // open for main review — exact path format TBD
      "SoliEstre/EstreGenesis:Constellation.md§13.14-§13.15 → <hub-repo>:WS-PROTOCOL.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

The match key is `(sourceRepo, sourceContentRef) → (targetRepo, targetContentRef)`. When a `PRRequest` carries `category: 'trusted-mirror'` and the source→target pair matches an entry in this list, the PR is created without per-PR user prompt.

**Opt-in shape**: the user adds an entry to the trusted-mirror list once; subsequent PRs in that pairing flow without prompts. The user can revoke entries; removed pairings fall back to `standard` opt-in. Per-deployment policy may also rate-limit (e.g., "at most one trusted-mirror PR per source→target pair per 24h" to catch a runaway automation).

### 6.2 `standard` (per-PR user opt-in, the default)

Any PR not matching a trusted-mirror entry. The agent emits `PRRequest`, and the PR-bot's first action is to surface the request to the user via the live board's `decisions` panel (per §13.17 — decisions panel is the canonical user-attention surface for structured choices). The user explicitly approves; on approval, the PR is created.

This is the autonomous-execution gate (b) external-publish default — the user remains in the loop for any PR not pre-authorized via trusted-mirror.

### 6.3 `emergency` (out-of-band approval reference)

For hotfix PRs (e.g., a security patch that needs to mirror within the hour, faster than the user can respond on the board), the `PRRequest` carries an `emergency: true` flag *and* an `outOfBandApprovalRef` field (e.g., a board `decisions` panel message id the user has already approved out-of-band).

The PR-bot validates the `outOfBandApprovalRef` against the live board's `decisions` panel persistence (the approval must exist and must match the PR scope). If valid, the PR is created immediately; if invalid, the request is rejected with a `decisions`-panel surfacing for the user.

**Open question for main review** (§10 Q3): should `emergency` exist at all in v0.1, or should hotfix PRs route through the `standard` flow with an accelerated user-prompt cadence?

### 6.5 `inline-section-mirror` semantics (v0.3 addition)

The `inline-section-mirror` `kind` (per §4.1.1) is the canonical content-sourcing form for spec-mirror PRs that append a self-contained section to an existing file on the target repo (the §10 dogfood case is the prototype). The full payload semantics:

- **`body`** (string, required) — the literal text to apply. For `mergeStrategy: 'append-section'`, this is the section body that gets appended to the end of `targetPath`. Newline-terminated.
- **`targetPath`** (string, required) — repo-relative path to the file being modified. See §6.6 for the base-spec.
- **`mergeStrategy`** (string enum, required) — the apply mode. Currently only `'append-section'` is defined. Future enum values (open for main review): `'prepend-section'` (insert at top), `'replace-section'` (replace existing section identified by some anchor), `'insert-after-anchor'` (insert after a named anchor line).

**Bridge invariants** (the v0.3 receiver MUST observe all of these):

1. **`git add` isolation** — after applying the `body` to `targetPath`, the bridge MUST `git add <targetPath>` and ONLY `<targetPath>`. The bridge MUST NOT `git add -A` or `git add .`. The §10A dogfood-1 defect #2 showed why: a fallthrough to `-A` would commit every untracked file in the target-repo checkout (including the entire EG-repo checkout if the bridge happened to be running from a parent directory). File-level `git add` keeps the commit footprint deterministic and isolated.
2. **No branch-fetch** — the `inline-section-mirror` handler MUST NOT invoke `git fetch` or `git checkout FETCH_HEAD`. The content is entirely in the `body` payload; no remote read is required. Falling through to the `branch-ref` handler's fetch step is the failure mode the fail-safe reject (§4.1.1) prevents.
3. **PR_LIVE existence check** — before appending in `PR_LIVE` mode, the bridge MUST verify the target file exists (`fs.existsSync(path.resolve(HUB_REPO_DIR, targetPath))`). If the file does not exist, the bridge MUST reject with `PRRequestRejected { reason: 'inline-mirror-target-missing', targetPath, abs: <resolved-absolute-path> }` rather than create an orphan file at the resolved path. The §10A dogfood-1 defect #3 showed why: an unresolved `targetPath` would have created an orphan `WS-PROTOCOL.md` at the hub repo root rather than appending to the real `dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md`.
4. **Dry-run `abs+exists` log** — when `CONSTELLATION_PR_LIVE` is OFF, the bridge MUST log `abs=<resolved-absolute-path> exists=<bool>` so path-resolution defects surface BEFORE PR_LIVE flips on. See §10.6.

### 6.6 `targetPath` base specification (v0.3 addition)

`targetPath` is **relative to the receiving bridge's `HUB_REPO_DIR`** — i.e., the repository root of the receiving bridge's target-repo checkout, equivalent to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` of the bridge process's target-repo working directory. The dogfood-1 case study (§10A defect #3) made this explicit after the original (unstated) convention was ambiguous between three possible bases:

| Base candidate | Status | Rationale |
|----------------|--------|-----------|
| `HUB_REPO_DIR` (target-repo root) | **CANONICAL** (v0.3) | Repo-relative; deterministic for both sender and receiver; matches how `git add` works; portable across operator setups. |
| Bridge process cwd | NOT used | Process cwd is environment-dependent and not knowable to the sender. |
| Absolute filesystem path | NOT used | Reveals operator filesystem layout; not portable; breaks cross-machine repro. |
| Sub-tree-relative (e.g., a `dashboard/` sub-tree root) | NOT used | Two repos with the same sub-tree name would have ambiguous bases. |

**Examples** (for a hub-repo checkout where the target file lives at `dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md`):

- ✅ `targetPath: "dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md"` (sub-path from `HUB_REPO_DIR`).
- ❌ `targetPath: "WS-PROTOCOL.md"` (would resolve to the hub repo root — file does not exist there; bridge rejects with `inline-mirror-target-missing`).
- ❌ `targetPath: "/c/Users/.../hub-repo/dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md"` (absolute path; bridge rejects).
- ❌ `targetPath: "live/WS-PROTOCOL.md"` (sub-tree-relative; bridge rejects — does not exist at `<HUB_REPO_DIR>/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md`).

**Sender responsibility**: the sender MUST know the receiver's actual file layout. For trusted-mirror PRs, the layout is part of the deployment-policy registry (§6.1); for `standard` PRs, the sender is expected to either know the layout (from prior PR experience) or accept a `targetPath`-base correction loop with the receiver. The `abs+exists` dry-run log (§6.5 invariant 4) makes the corrective loop cheap (one dry-run reveals the resolved absolute path + existence, the sender corrects the sub-path, the next dry-run passes).

### 6.7 Where the line goes (open for main review)

The proposal: **for v0.1, only `trusted-mirror` and `standard` ship; `emergency` is deferred to phase 3.** Reasoning:

- `trusted-mirror` is the §9 dogfood requirement — it must ship.
- `standard` is the safe fallback that preserves the autonomous-execution gate semantics — it must ship.
- `emergency` is a power-user feature whose security model needs more design (out-of-band approval has a TOCTOU-style risk surface that's not worth dragging into v0.1).

Main upstream may steer the boundary.

## 7. Cross-repo content sourcing — three options

How does the PR-bot agent get the bytes for the PR diff? Three options:

### 7.α Inline diff in `PRRequest` payload

The requester computes the diff (against the target branch's HEAD) and sends the unified-diff bytes as part of `PRRequest.filesDiff`. The PR-bot reconstructs a temporary branch in the target repo, applies the diff, and creates the PR from that branch.

**Trade-offs**:

- **Pros**: simplest semantics — the wire carries the whole PR content; no separate repo access needed beyond the PR-bot's target-repo push permission.
- **Cons**: breaks at scale. The §13.13 / §2 wire is fine for small messages but the W20/W22 outbox split-delivery pattern surfaces at ~80KB+ payloads. A multi-file spec mirror (e.g., touching `Constellation.md` + `_lessons/*` + `seeds/*` in one PR) easily exceeds that. Suitable only for small diffs; not a general solution.

### 7.β Source-branch ref on source repo (initial v0.1 form)

The requester pushes a branch to the *source* repo (e.g., EG's `mirror/§13.14-§13.15-to-hub` branch) and sends the branch ref in `PRRequest.sourceContentRef`. The PR-bot reads the branch contents via the provider's git API (or `git fetch`) and either creates the PR from that branch directly, or pushes the branch contents to a target-side branch and creates the PR from there.

**Trade-offs**:

- **Pros**: works at any diff scale; reuses standard git/provider mechanisms.
- **Cons**: requires push access to the source repo (the requester has that for EG; needs to be checked for any other source-repo case); requires the PR-bot to have read access to the source repo (token scope expansion); the cross-repo provider-side authorization for "PR from source-repo branch into target repo" introduces complications when source and target are different orgs.

### 7.β′ Mirror branch on TARGET repo (Phase 1 ship form, adopted)

A variant of β: instead of pushing the branch to the source repo and having the PR-bot fetch cross-repo, the local-bridge pushes the source content directly to a `mirror/...` branch on the **target** repo, then opens the PR from that target-side mirror branch into the target's integration branch. The PR is effectively intra-repo at the provider level; no cross-repo provider authorization is required.

This is the form adopted by Phase 1 ship `2213a14`. Concretely, `handlePrRequest` (Level 2 path):

1. Reads the source content from the local-bridge's checkout of the source repo.
2. Pushes a `mirror/<topic>` branch to the *target* repo (using the operator's `gh` / `git` credentials for the target).
3. Invokes `gh pr create --repo <targetRepo> --base <targetBranch> --head mirror/<topic> ...`.
4. Emits `PRDraftReady` with the resulting PR number.

**Trade-offs**:

- **Pros**: avoids cross-repo provider-side authorization (the PR is intra-target at the provider tier); cleaner audit trail on the target repo (the mirror branch lives where the PR lives); works for any source/target org pairing; reuses the operator's existing target-repo credentials.
- **Cons**: requires push access to the target repo (the operator's `gh` credentials must cover the target); the mirror branch is a transient artifact on the target repo (cleanup policy needed — Phase 1 ship leaves the branch in place after merge, relying on provider auto-delete-head-branch settings).

### 7.γ Fork-based (standard GitHub workflow)

The requester pushes to their own fork of the target repo (a user-account fork of `<hub-repo>` or whatever the target is) and the PR-bot creates the PR from fork → target. Standard GitHub cross-repo PR workflow.

**Trade-offs**:

- **Pros**: matches the provider's intended workflow; no special permissions on the target repo beyond fork (which is open); audit trail is clean (fork owner is identified).
- **Cons**: requires the requester (or the requester's principal) to maintain a fork of every target repo; adds a sync step (the fork must be kept up to date with the upstream); more moving parts.

### 7.δ Recommendation — β′ primary (Phase 1 ship), α small-diff fallback

**Phase 1 ship `2213a14` adopted β′ as the primary Level 2 content-sourcing form.** This supersedes the v0.1 "β with α fallback" recommendation. Updated v0.2 recommendation:

- **Level 2: β′ as primary**; α fallback only for small Level 2 diffs (< ~50 KB) where direct payload transfer is simpler than mirror-branch push. β (source-repo branch) and γ (fork-based) are not used in Phase 1 / Phase 1b scope.
- **Level 1**: content sourcing is implicit — the receiving side reads from the source-content payload (either an inline `filesDiff` or a fetched source-repo ref the receiving side already has access to as part of its operator-shared filesystem). No mirror branch on the target repo is needed (the change goes straight to the integration branch on commit).

Rationale (β′ vs β): cross-repo provider authorization complications inherent to β (the PR-bot needs read access to the source repo's branch at the provider tier) are avoided by β′ (the source content lands on the target repo's own branch before `gh pr create`, making the PR intra-target at the provider level).

### 7.ε `trusted_mirrors.targetRepo` alias resolve order (v0.3 addition)

The §6.1 `trusted_mirrors` registry's `targetRepo` field SHOULD use a stable **alias** (the default convention is the literal string `"hub"`) rather than the real repo identifier. This shields the public-shipped registry from leaking the real production repo path (§13.14 redaction discipline) and lets the receiving bridge resolve aliases at runtime.

**Default alias convention**: receiving bridges SHOULD register `"hub"` as the default `targetRepo` for the receiving side. Senders emit `PRRequest { targetRepo: "hub", ... }` as the canonical convention; the receiver resolves `"hub"` to the real repo identifier via the lookup order below.

**Resolve order** (the receiving bridge's `matchTrustedMirror` invokes these in sequence; first match wins):

1. **`state.json.pr_system.target_aliases`** (operator-set, primary) — a `{ "hub": "<real-repo-identifier>", ... }` map in `state.json`. The operator sets this once per deployment; subsequent `PRRequest` resolutions are constant-time.
2. **`git remote get-url origin`** of the receiving bridge's target-repo checkout (fallback) — if `target_aliases["hub"]` is unset, the bridge derives the real repo identifier from `git remote get-url origin` (parsed to `org/repo` form). This is the zero-config path for the common single-target-repo case.
3. **Reject** — if neither resolves, the bridge rejects with `PRRequestRejected { reason: 'unknown-target-repo-alias', alias: <received-value> }`.

The dogfood-1 case study (§10A defect #1) showed why this matters: the v0.2 form used `<hub-repo>` as a literal placeholder in the RRP examples, and the early Phase 1b implementation did a literal-string lookup against `<hub-repo>` in the registry, which never matched the real repo identifier. Adding the alias resolve order made the registry portable across operator deployments while keeping the public-shipped RRP redaction-safe.

**Redaction-safe by default** (§13.14 cross-link): because the `targetRepo` field on the wire is the alias (`"hub"`) and the real repo identifier lives only in `state.json` (operator-local, not public-shipped) or is derived from `git remote get-url origin` at runtime, the A2A wire envelopes never carry the real production repo path. Public-shipped RRP examples can use `"hub"` literally without leaking.

## 8. Authority + permission table extension to §13.20

The §13.20 permission table covers blocker tracking + nudge cadence. This RRP extends it with PR-lifecycle ops. Proposed additions (slot into the existing §13.20.5 table at joint formalization):

| Message type | Who may emit | Server filter / authority gate |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| `PRRequest` | Any role (`main` / `collab` / `upstream` / `local`) | Server validates `sourceRepo` and `targetRepo` are in the deployment's known-repo registry; rejects targets outside the registry. For `level == 1`, server additionally validates the receiving side's capability matrix (direct push to target + operator-shared). |
| `PRDraftReady` | PR-bot agent (Level 2) OR receiving-side agent with target-repo push capability (Level 1) | Server validates the `for: msgId` references an actual `PRRequest` from a registered requester |
| `PRReviewAck` | Any agent with reviewer-role authority on the target repo (per §13.9 role table for that repo) | Server validates the emitter's role against the per-repo reviewer policy |
| `PRMergeRequest` | **Only** `role == main` for the target repo | Strict — server rejects emissions from non-main roles (Phase 1 ship `2213a14` `wsPrMergeReject` path); logged to `decisions` panel for audit on rejection |
| `PRMergeAck` | PR-bot agent (Level 2) OR receiving-side agent (Level 1) | Server validates `for: msgId` references an actual `PRMergeRequest` |
| `PRStatusUpdate` | PR-bot agent (Level 2) OR receiving-side agent (Level 1) | Server validates the emitter against the bot identity registry (Level 2) or the receiving-side capability matrix (Level 1) |

### 8.1 Cross-repo role mapping (open for main review)

A subtle case: when EG (whose `role == main` for the EG repo) issues a `PRMergeRequest` against `<hub-repo>` (where EG is a `peer/upstream` per §13.9, NOT `main`), the request must be **rejected** because EG is not `main` for the target. The merge authority on `<hub-repo>` rests with the `<hub-repo>` main-role agent (typically named `hub` or `main-prod` in the orchestration tree).

The cross-repo role mapping table (per-repo `role` value, not per-deployment):

| Repo | EG agent role | `<hub-repo>` main agent role |
|------|---------------|------------------------------|
| EG (`SoliEstre/EstreGenesis`) | `main` | `peer/upstream` |
| `<hub-repo>` | `peer/upstream` | `main` |

The role is **per-repo, not per-deployment**. This composes with §13.9's role-branching but adds a dimension: an agent's role is a function of (agent identity, target repo), not just (agent identity). The §13.22 permission table must encode this.

**Open question for main review** (§10 Q4): is per-repo role the right model, or should the protocol require a `PRRequest` to specify which agent on the target repo holds `main` and route `PRMergeRequest` to that agent explicitly?

---

## 9. State machine — 5-state PR lifecycle (level-discriminated)

The PR lifecycle is modeled as a 5-state machine. Both Level 1 and Level 2 traverse the same five logical states; transition triggers differ per level.

**Level 2** (the form shipped in Phase 1): transitions are driven by provider events (translated by the PR-bot / local-bridge into `PRStatusUpdate` emissions) and by review-authority emissions (`PRReviewAck`, `PRMergeRequest`). MERGED ≡ `gh pr merge` succeeded and the provider reports the PR as merged.

**Level 1** (Phase 1b path): transitions are driven entirely by A2A envelope events; there is no provider state to translate. `PRDraftReady` carries the staged commit SHA on the target checkout; `PRReviewAck` carries the verdict; `PRMergeRequest` triggers the receiving side to commit the staged change to the target's integration branch and push; MERGED ≡ the push succeeded and the integration-branch commit SHA is reported in `PRMergeAck`. CHANGES_REQUESTED in Level 1 loops back to the source agent updating its `sourceContentRef` (a new commit on the source side, communicated via a follow-up `PRRequest` with `for: previousDraftRef` linkage, or via an out-of-band update mechanism the v0.2 RRP leaves open for refinement).

```

Side paths: from any state, the PR can transition to CLOSED (closed without merge — e.g., superseded by another PR, or explicitly withdrawn by the requester).

### 9.1 Composition with §13.19 deadlock detection

A PR that stays in `IN_REVIEW` or `CHANGES_REQUESTED` beyond an SLA threshold without progress is a **quasi-deadlock candidate** per §13.19.2:

- `IN_REVIEW` for longer than the `PRRequest.slaEta` (or the deployment's default review SLA, ~24h-2-cycle per §13.19.4) without a `PRReviewAck` → the requester emits `BlockerNudge` per §13.20.4 targeting the reviewer (subject: reviewer agent id; reason: "PR #N awaiting review").
- `CHANGES_REQUESTED` for longer than the requester's stated follow-up SLA → the reviewer emits `BlockerNudge` targeting the requester.

Both directions reuse the §13.20 ladder (polite → explicit → deadline → human). A PR that escalates to §13.20 tier-4 routes to the board `decisions` panel (per §13.17) with `class: 'pr-stalled'` (extending §13.20.6's `EscalationRequest.class` enum).

### 9.2 Composition with §13.13 ack layer

Every PR-lifecycle emission gets server-auto `Ack{delivered}` per §13.13. The PR-bot's `PRDraftReady` IS the `AckProcessed` for the originating `PRRequest` (or, per §4.3 open question, `AckProcessed` is emitted first and `PRDraftReady` follows). `PRReviewAck` is the application-tier ack for the review request implied by the PR being in `IN_REVIEW`. The §13.13 conservative multi-probe + human-escalation tail applies if a `PRDraftReady` does not arrive within expected window — the requester `Ping`s the PR-bot, and if no `Pong`, escalates via `decisions` panel.

### 9.3 `already-in-target` cherry-pick skip discipline (v0.3 addition — Level 1 merge handler)

In the Level 1 path, the receiving bridge has already committed the staged change to the target repo's **local** integration branch at `applyDiffAndCommit` time (the `PRDraftReady` commit SHA lives on local `main`, not on a separate staging branch). When `PRMergeRequest` arrives, the conventional merge-handler shape — "cherry-pick the staged commit onto the integration branch, then push" — would attempt to cherry-pick a commit that is already in the local branch's history, producing a duplicate-commit error (or, if the cherry-pick succeeded, a duplicate commit on the integration branch).

**The skip rule** (v0.3 invariant for Level 1 merge handlers):

```text
on PRMergeRequest:
    if git merge-base --is-ancestor <draftRef> <targetBranch>:
        # draftRef is already in targetBranch's history → no cherry-pick needed
        proceed directly to: git push origin <targetBranch>
    else:
        git cherry-pick <draftRef>
        git push origin <targetBranch>
```

The receiving bridge MUST check `git merge-base --is-ancestor <draftRef> <targetBranch>` BEFORE attempting cherry-pick. If the check returns true (exit code 0), the cherry-pick step is a no-op and the bridge proceeds directly to push. If false, the bridge performs the cherry-pick normally.

**Why this matters**: the §10A dogfood-1 case study's e2e completion exercised this exact path. The receiving bridge's `applyDiffAndCommit` already committed `140fd64` to its local `main` (the local target-branch checkout). When `PRMergeRequest` arrived from the same agent (self-target merge relay — the receiving side is `role==main` for the target repo), the merge handler would have failed on a literal cherry-pick of `140fd64` because that commit was already in local `main`'s history. The skip rule lets the handler proceed cleanly to `git push origin main`, which is the only operation needed at that point.

**Level 2 not affected**: Level 2's merge handler invokes `gh pr merge`, which is the provider's API operation against a separate PR object — no local cherry-pick is involved. The skip rule is Level 1 only.

### 9.4 Live-board PR panel (open for main review — implementation ask)

Parallel to §13.20.7's blocker-manifest panel ask, this RRP proposes a **PR panel** on the live board surfacing the active PRs:

- Per-PR row: PR number · target repo · title · state (DRAFT/OPEN/IN_REVIEW/CHANGES_REQUESTED/APPROVED/MERGED) · age · last status update · current reviewer · escalation tier (if §13.20 ladder fired).
- Visual treatment matches §13.20.7: tier 1 neutral, tier 2 attention, tier 3 warning, tier 4 alert.
- Data source: the `PRStatusUpdate` snapshot stream from the PR-bot; the server persists the latest per PR; the panel reads from a new endpoint (`GET /api/prs` or equivalent).

Same sequencing rule as §13.20.7: the wire vocabulary lands first; the panel is the visualization upgrade. Until the panel ships, the human can observe PR state via `ws-history` directly.

## 10. Dogfood plan — §13.14 / §13.15 mirror as canonical first use case

The §13.22 protocol's **first production use** is the §13.14 / §13.15 mirror PR itself. This is explicit and non-negotiable: there is no "validate on a toy PR first" intermediate step.

**Level selection for the dogfood PR** (v0.2 addition): the dogfood PR is operated end-to-end by the same operator who runs both the EG repo and the `<hub-repo>`; both repos are directly accessible from the operator's local checkout. This satisfies the §2.4 Level 1 selection rule. Once Phase 1b ships the Level 1 path on the local-bridge, the dogfood PR is targeted as a **Level 1 mirror PR** — A2A envelopes only, receiving (= hub) side commits the §13.14/§13.15 mirror directly to the hub `WS-PROTOCOL.md` and pushes to the integration branch, no `gh pr create` involved. Until Phase 1b ships, the dogfood remains targeted as Level 2 (Phase 1 ship's existing path), at the cost of one extra provider-side PR object that will be merged through the provider's UI / API per the Level 2 sequence below.

### 10.1 Canonical first PR specification

- **Source repo**: `SoliEstre/EstreGenesis` (this repo — public).
- **Source content**: the bodies of `Constellation.md §13.14` (Reference-build redaction discipline) + `§13.15` (Reference-build syntax gate). Distilled per §13.14 itself (no env-token leaks); syntax-gated per §13.15 (no JSDoc traps).
- **Source branch**: `mirror/13.14-13.15-to-hub` (pushed to EG repo as the source-branch ref per §7.β).
- **Target repo**: `<hub-repo>` (the user's production hub — placeholder; real path lives in deployment policy).
- **Target branch**: `<hub-repo>`'s default branch (typically `main`).
- **Target content**: a new section in `<hub-repo>` `WS-PROTOCOL.md` mirroring the §13.14 + §13.15 bodies. The section number on the hub side is whatever the hub WS-PROTOCOL currently shows as the next-available (the hub may use a different numbering scheme than EG; the *content* is mirrored, not the section number).
- **Title**: `WS-PROTOCOL: add §X.Y/X.Z — Reference-build redaction + syntax gate (mirror from EG §13.14/§13.15)`.
- **Body**: provenance link back to EG `Constellation.md §13.14` + §13.15 commits; rationale (parity-of-safety-discipline gap); diff summary.
- **Labels**: `mirror`, `from-eg`, `protocol`.
- **Reviewers**: `<hub-repo>` main-role agent.
- **Category**: `trusted-mirror`.

### 10.2 Trusted-mirror policy entry

Before the dogfood PR fires, the user adds the trusted-mirror entry to `state.json` (or equivalent deployment policy file):

```jsonc
{
  "pr_system": {
    "trusted_mirrors": [
      "SoliEstre/EstreGenesis:Constellation.md§13.14-§13.15 → <hub-repo>:WS-PROTOCOL.md"
    ]
  }
}
```

This is a one-time setup; subsequent EG → `<hub-repo>` spec mirror PRs in the same pairing flow without per-PR prompts.

### 10.3 Sequence

1. EG agent confirms §13.14/§13.15 are in EG `Constellation.md` and passes the §13.14 redaction grep + §13.15 `node --check` gates.
2. EG agent pushes `mirror/13.14-13.15-to-hub` branch to EG repo with the mirror diff staged on top of the `<hub-repo>`'s `WS-PROTOCOL.md` HEAD.
3. EG agent emits `PRRequest { sourceRepo: EG, sourceBranch: mirror/13.14-13.15-to-hub, targetRepo: <hub-repo>, targetBranch: main, title, body, category: 'trusted-mirror', reviewers: [<hub-main>] }`.
4. Local-bridge (topology b) receives the `PRRequest`, validates the trusted-mirror entry, invokes `gh pr create` against `<hub-repo>`, emits `PRDraftReady { prNumber, prUrl, ... }` back to EG.
5. `<hub-repo>` main-role agent (or the user, if no hub-main is online) reviews the PR. On completion: `PRReviewAck { verdict: 'approve', ... }` to EG.
6. `<hub-repo>` main-role agent (or the user) emits `PRMergeRequest { mergeStrategy: 'squash' }`. Local-bridge invokes `gh pr merge`; `PRMergeAck { success: true }` flows back.
7. `PRStatusUpdate { state: 'merged' }` broadcast to all watchers; live-board PR panel reflects merged state; EG's deferred work parked on this blocker (per §13.20) clears.

### 10.4 Success criterion

The PR is created via the §13.22 A2A PR System protocol (not by manual user action in the GitHub UI), reviewed via `PRReviewAck`, merged via `PRMergeRequest` / `PRMergeAck`. The user's role is limited to: (a) one-time trusted-mirror policy entry (§10.2), (b) optionally observing the live board PR panel during the lifecycle, (c) being available if the §13.19 / §13.20 escalation tiers fire (which, for a clean dogfood pass, they should not).

If any step requires manual user PR-UI interaction, the dogfood has not validated the protocol. Iteration is expected; the §12 phase 1 prototype is the right place for iteration; the §12 phase 2 dedicated PR-bot is the right place for the steady-state.

### 10.5 Failure modes the dogfood will surface

(Listed so they are looked for, not hidden):

- Topology-b authentication scope mismatch (`gh` CLI authed for EG but not `<hub-repo>`, or scoped to a token that lacks PR-create permission).
- `PRRequest` payload size (the §13.14 + §13.15 bodies are ~3KB combined — small enough to use option α inline-diff per §7, or option β with branch ref — but the mirror PR may also touch related files that grow the diff).
- `<hub-repo>` `WS-PROTOCOL.md`'s exact section-numbering policy (the hub may need a manual section-number assignment that the trusted-mirror automation does not know about).
- Cross-repo role mapping (§8.1) edge cases — does the EG agent's `role == main` on EG correctly demote to `peer/upstream` when issuing `PRRequest` against `<hub-repo>`?

Each surfaced failure becomes a §13.22 sub-section refinement or a §10 open question's resolved answer.

### 10.6 Dry-run limitations and the `abs+exists` verification log (v0.3 addition)

Dry-run mode (`CONSTELLATION_PR_LIVE` env OFF — the Phase 1 / Phase 1b default per §13) traditionally short-circuited every git-mutating operation: no `git checkout FETCH_HEAD`, no `git apply`, no `git add`, no `git commit`, no `git push`. The implicit assumption was that since no real write occurs, no real validation matters either — the dry-run was treated as a no-op stub.

The §10A dogfood-1 case study exposed the gap in that assumption: a `targetPath` whose resolution fails (file does not exist at the resolved absolute path) is a defect that surfaces only at PR_LIVE time, because the traditional dry-run never resolved or stat'd the path. The result was a path-resolution defect that could not be caught until PR_LIVE was enabled and a real (incorrect) operation almost ran.

**The v0.3 requirement** (Phase 1b-onward): dry-run mode MUST log the path-resolution result for any `inline-section-mirror` (and any other `kind` whose handler resolves a target file). The log line shape:

```text
[dry-run] would <operation>(<size> bytes) to <targetPath> · abs=<absolute-path> · exists=<bool>
```

Concretely for `inline-section-mirror`:

```text
[dry-run] would append inline-section-mirror(1234 bytes) to dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md · abs=/c/Users/.../hub-repo/dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md · exists=true
```

The `abs` field is the result of `path.resolve(HUB_REPO_DIR, targetPath)`. The `exists` field is `fs.existsSync(<abs>)`. If `exists` is `false`, the operator + sender + reviewer can diagnose the path-resolution defect from the dry-run output alone — no PR_LIVE flip is required.

**Composition with §6.5 invariant 4 + §6.6 base spec**: the `abs+exists` log is the operational test of the §6.6 base-spec ("`targetPath` is relative to `HUB_REPO_DIR`"). If the sender encoded the wrong base, the `exists=false` log surfaces it. If the operator's `HUB_REPO_DIR` is misconfigured, the `abs` log surfaces that too (the absolute path will point to the wrong directory).

### 10.7 `PR_LIVE` env semantics + `dryRun: false` marker + user merge delegation (v0.3 addition)

**`CONSTELLATION_PR_LIVE` env semantics**: a process-level environment variable on the **receiving bridge** that gates whether git operations are executed (`PR_LIVE=1` → execute) or stubbed (`PR_LIVE=0` or absent → dry-run). The variable is an operator-managed safety; it is NOT toggled via A2A envelopes. A2A merely **uses** the operator's setting — the sender cannot turn PR_LIVE on remotely. This preserves the autonomous-execution gate (b) external-publish: a sender requesting a real PR depends on the receiving operator having pre-authorized real execution by setting the env variable.

**`dryRun` marker on outbound envelopes**: the receiving bridge SHOULD include a `dryRun: <bool>` field on `PRDraftReady` and `PRMergeAck` envelopes to disambiguate the result. `dryRun: false` means real git operations executed; `dryRun: true` means stubbed. The marker is informational (the sender can infer dryRun state from `draftRef`'s shape — a real commit SHA vs a placeholder — but the explicit field is clearer and forwards-compatible if dry-run stubs evolve to produce real-looking placeholders).

**User merge delegation pattern**: when the operator/user trusts the protocol's gates (`category: trusted-mirror`, redaction grep, `abs+exists` verification, role-gated `PRMergeRequest`) for a class of PRs, the operator can pre-delegate merge authority for that class. The shape: the operator surfaces a directive like "for trusted-mirror category PRs, review and if no problem found, merge and push without per-PR confirmation." The receiving bridge's `role==main` agent then emits `PRMergeRequest` autonomously on review approval. This reduces per-PR confirmation overhead without bypassing the §13.17 decisions-panel mechanism for non-trusted-category PRs.

The delegation is per-operator policy, not a protocol-level invariant — different operators may set different delegation thresholds. The protocol's job is to make the per-PR signal (category, review verdict, gate results) legible enough that the operator can confidently set the delegation policy.

## 10A. Dogfood-1 case study — first Level 1 protocol-mediated PR completion (v0.3 addition)

The §10 dogfood plan's first execution completed end-to-end as a Level 1 protocol-mediated PR. This sub-section documents the e2e path traversed, the three structural defects surfaced and resolved by the gate stack, the final integration-branch commit SHA, and the AC-dogfood-6 achievement. This is the **canonical reference case** for downstream Constellation adopters considering Level 1 adoption — what to look for, what gates work.

### 10A.1 e2e protocol path traversed

The complete envelope chain that landed the §13.14/§13.15 mirror at integration-branch commit `140fd64`:

```text
EG agent:    PRRequest { level: 1, category: 'trusted-mirror',
                          sourceContentRef: { kind: 'inline-section-mirror',
                                              body: <§13.14+§13.15 bodies>,
                                              targetPath: 'dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md',
                                              mergeStrategy: 'append-section' },
                          targetRepo: 'hub', targetBranch: 'main', ... }
                 ↓ (A2A)
Hub bridge:  matchTrustedMirror → resolve('hub') → real-repo identifier via target_aliases (or `git remote origin` fallback)
                 ↓
Hub bridge:  wsPrLevel1Capable check → capability OK
                 ↓
Hub bridge:  applyDiffAndCommit (PR_LIVE on)
                 → append <body> to <HUB_REPO_DIR>/dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md
                 → git add dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md  (isolated; NOT -A)
                 → git commit (local main)
                 → result: commit 140fd64 (30 insertions, 1 file)
                 ↓ (A2A)
Hub bridge:  PRDraftReady { dryRun: false, draftRef: '140fd64', ... }
                 ↓
EG agent:    review (redaction grep: 0 hits; path consistency: confirmed; duplicate check: clean)
                 ↓ (A2A)
EG agent:    PRReviewAck { verdict: 'approve', ... }
                 ↓ (A2A)
Hub-main role agent:  PRMergeRequest (role==main self-target relay; the receiving bridge is itself role==main for the target repo)
                 ↓
Hub bridge:  git merge-base --is-ancestor 140fd64 main → true (draftRef already in main local history)
                 → cherry-pick skip (§9.3 discipline)
                 → git push origin main
                 ↓ (A2A)
Hub bridge:  PRMergeAck { pushSuccess: true, commitSha: '140fd64' }
                 ↓ (A2A)
Hub bridge:  PRStatusUpdate { state: 'merged', draftRef: '140fd64' }
```

Final origin/main HEAD: `140fd64` (confirmed via `git ls-remote origin main`).

### 10A.2 Three structural defects surfaced and resolved (gate value validated)

All three defects were caught by the dry-run + review + `abs+exists` gates BEFORE any external publish. The gate stack's empirical value is: three near-disasters prevented, zero damage incurred.

**Defect #1 — `<hub-repo>` placeholder lookup failure** (resolved → §7.ε alias resolve order)
- *Symptom*: receiving bridge's `wsPrLevel1Capable` capability check + `matchTrustedMirror` lookup did literal-string compares against `<hub-repo>` placeholder text in the registry; the real repo identifier never matched, capability check failed.
- *Root cause*: v0.2 RRP used `<hub-repo>` as a placeholder in examples; early Phase 1b registry entries inherited the literal placeholder.
- *Resolution*: added `state.json.pr_system.target_aliases { "hub": "<real-repo-id>" }` primary lookup + `git remote get-url origin` fallback. Default alias name `"hub"` agreed; senders emit `targetRepo: "hub"` as the canonical convention.
- *Codified at*: §7.ε.

**Defect #2 — bridge missing `inline-section-mirror` handler** (resolved → §4.1.1 fail-safe + §6.5 invariants)
- *Symptom*: Phase 1b bridge's `applyDiffAndCommit` had no branch for `sourceContentRef.kind === 'inline-section-mirror'`; the unknown-kind path fell through to the default `branch-ref` handler.
- *Root cause*: the `branch-ref` handler invoked `git fetch + git checkout FETCH_HEAD -- .`, which against the sender's branch (EG repo's `main`) would have wholesale-overwritten the receiving bridge's target-repo checkout with EG-repo content. Effectively: an entire-EG-repo commit into hub `main`.
- *Resolution*: added the explicit `inline-section-mirror` branch with `git add <targetPath>` isolation (file-level, never `-A`) and no branch-fetch. Codified the fail-safe rule that the receiving bridge MUST reject unknown `kind` values rather than fall through.
- *Codified at*: §4.1.1 fail-safe default + §6.5 invariants 1 (`git add` isolation) and 2 (no branch-fetch).

**Defect #3 — `targetPath` base mismatch** (resolved → §6.6 base spec + §6.5 invariant 3 + §10.6 dry-run log)
- *Symptom*: sender sent `targetPath: "WS-PROTOCOL.md"` (literal, no sub-path); the real file lived at `dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md`. The receiving bridge's `HUB_REPO_DIR` resolution produced `<hub-repo-root>/WS-PROTOCOL.md`, which did not exist. In PR_LIVE mode without an existence check, the bridge would have created an orphan file at the repo root.
- *Root cause*: `targetPath`'s base was unstated in v0.2 — three reasonable candidates (absolute path, bridge-cwd-relative, `HUB_REPO_DIR`-relative) were equally plausible from the spec text. Sender chose the wrong one.
- *Resolution*: bridge logs `abs=<resolved-absolute-path> exists=<bool>` in dry-run mode (so the defect surfaces before PR_LIVE) and rejects with `inline-mirror-target-missing` in PR_LIVE mode (so the orphan-file scenario cannot land). Sender corrected payload to `dashboard/live/WS-PROTOCOL.md`. §6.6 documents the `HUB_REPO_DIR`-relative base as canonical.
- *Codified at*: §6.5 invariant 3 (PR_LIVE existence check) + §6.6 base spec + §10.6 dry-run `abs+exists` log.

### 10A.3 AC-dogfood-6 achievement

The §12.3 acceptance criterion **AC-dogfood-6 (Level 1)** — "the first Level 1 mirror PR (EG → `<hub-repo>` `WS-PROTOCOL.md` §13.14/§13.15 mirror) succeeds end-to-end via A2A envelopes only — receiving (= hub) side directly applies the change to its local checkout of the target repo, commits, pushes to the integration branch, and reports the resulting commit SHA in `PRMergeAck`. No `gh pr create` is involved" — is **achieved** by the PR #1 e2e completion above. The full chain ran via A2A envelopes only; no provider PR object was created; the integration-branch commit SHA `140fd64` is reported in `PRMergeAck { pushSuccess: true, commitSha: '140fd64' }`.

### 10A.4 Lessons for downstream Constellation adopters

For downstream projects considering Level 1 adoption:

- **Run the dry-run gate FIRST**. The `abs+exists` log surfaces path-resolution defects without any real write. Skipping dry-run to "save time" defeats the gate stack.
- **Verify the `kind` enum coverage on the receiving bridge** before any PR_LIVE flip. The fail-safe reject for unknown `kind` values is the safety net; confirm the bridge actually implements it (not silently falls through).
- **Set `state.json.pr_system.target_aliases` explicitly**. Don't rely on the `git remote get-url origin` fallback for multi-target deployments; the explicit alias map is constant-time and unambiguous.
- **The redaction grep + path-consistency review on PRReviewAck is non-optional**. Even for trusted-mirror category PRs, the reviewer agent's `PRReviewAck` step ran the §13.14 redaction grep + duplicate-section check. Both gates returned clean for PR #1; the discipline is the gate.
- **The user merge delegation pattern is opt-in by class**, not blanket. Delegating "review and if no problem, merge and push" for `trusted-mirror` PRs is reasonable; delegating it for `standard` PRs is not.

## 11. Open questions (main upstream review required)

Items where the EG-side draft has a working position but main upstream's reaction is load-bearing. The top 3 are flagged as **priority** — these are the questions where main's answer most shapes the rest of the protocol.

### Q1. **(priority — RESOLVED)** Topology — local-bridge `cmd:createPR` accepted

**Resolved**: Phase 1 ship `2213a14` adopted topology (b) — local-bridge runs in the operator's IDE process and uses the operator's `gh` CLI authentication. PRs created under the operator's `gh` CLI identity are accepted as legitimate by the cross-repo target. No separate bot identity is required for Phase 1 / Phase 1b scope.

**Downstream effect**: §5.d recommendation confirmed as the adopted form. Credential-management RRP deferred to phase 2 (only needed if cross-machine or separate-identity requirements appear).

### Q2. **(priority — RESOLVED)** Content-sourcing — β′ adopted (mirror branch on target repo)

**Resolved**: Phase 1 ship `2213a14` adopted β′ (a variant of β: the local-bridge pushes the source content to a `mirror/...` branch on the **target** repo, not the source repo). Rationale: cross-repo provider-side authorization complications inherent to β (the PR-bot needs read access to the source repo's branch at the provider tier) are sidestepped by β′ — the source content lands on the target repo's own branch before `gh pr create`, making the PR intra-target at the provider level.

**Downstream effect**: §7 updated — β′ is the primary Level 2 form; α remains a small-diff fallback; β and γ are not used in Phase 1 / Phase 1b scope.

### Q3. **(priority — RESOLVED)** Authority model — strict `role == main` gate adopted

**Resolved**: Phase 1 ship `2213a14` adopted the strict gate. The server's `wsPrMergeReject` path enforces "only `role == main` on the target repo may emit `PRMergeRequest`" — emissions from non-`main` roles are rejected at the server with a logged `decisions` panel entry. The protocol's authority chain is deterministic and independent of provider ACL drift.

**Downstream effect**: §4.4 wire vocabulary, §8 permission table, and §10 dogfood step 6 (Level 2 path) all confirmed as the strict-gate form. The per-repo role model (Q4 below) remains the open dimension; the strict-gate decision composes either way.

### Q4. Per-repo role vs per-deployment role

§8.1 proposes per-repo role (an agent's role is a function of agent identity AND target repo). The alternative is per-deployment role (an agent has one role globally, and cross-repo authority is encoded separately as ACL). The per-repo model composes more naturally with §13.9 but expands the role-table dimensionality.

**Main's answer steers**: §13.9 cross-link in §13.22; whether the §13.9 role table itself needs an extension or only §13.22's table.

### Q5. `emergency` category — does v0.1 include it?

§6.4 recommends deferring `emergency` to phase 3. The alternative is to include it now with a tighter security model (e.g., require the `outOfBandApprovalRef` to be cryptographically signed). If `<hub-repo>` operations have any hotfix scenarios that v0.1 needs to support, `emergency` may be forced into v0.1 scope.

**Main's answer steers**: §6 categories; §12 phase scope.

### Q6. Two-ack vs one-ack on `PRReviewAck` (§4.3 open question)

§4.3 recommends two-ack (`AckProcessed` from PR-bot on request parse + `PRReviewAck` from reviewer on completion). The alternative is one-ack (`PRReviewAck` carries both semantics). The two-ack proposal preserves §13.13's three-grade taxonomy cleanly; the one-ack proposal is leaner on the wire.

**Main's answer steers**: §4.3 vocabulary; §13.13 cross-link semantics in §13.22.

### Q7. Live-board PR panel — separate panel or extension of existing panels?

§9.4 proposes a separate PR panel parallel to §13.20.7's blocker-manifest panel. The alternative is to fold PR rows into the blocker panel (since a stalled PR IS a blocker per §9.1). Folding reduces panel proliferation; separating gives PR state its own visual surface.

**Main's answer steers**: live-board UX; `app.js` impl scope.

### Q8. Trusted-mirror policy path format

§6.1 sketches the trusted-mirror entry format (`source-repo:source-content-ref → target-repo:target-content-ref`). The exact path format (file-level? section-level? line-range?) is open. Section-level is what the §10 dogfood needs; line-range may be overkill; file-level may be too coarse.

**Main's answer steers**: `state.json` schema; §6.1 wire shape.

---

## 12. Acceptance criteria — when does §13.22 ship?

The §13.22 protocol is considered shipped when:

### 12.1 Spec criteria

- **AC-spec-1**: §13.22 sub-section authored in `Constellation.md`, cross-linked to §13.9 / §13.11 / §13.13 / §13.17 / §13.19 / §13.20, passes §13.14 redaction grep + §13.15 syntax gate.
- **AC-spec-2**: Permission table in §13.22 (parallel to §13.20.5's table format) covers all five `CUSTOM` types from §4 with explicit who-may-emit + server-filter columns.
- **AC-spec-3**: Open questions §11 Q1-Q3 (priority) have resolved answers from main upstream review; non-priority Q4-Q8 may be deferred to follow-on RRPs.

### 12.2 Implementation criteria

- **AC-impl-1**: Local-bridge `createPR` command implemented (topology b per §5.d) — adds one new command to `local-bridge.eux`, one provider CLI invocation, emits `PRDraftReady` per §4.2.
- **AC-impl-2**: Server-side validation of the five `CUSTOM` types per the §8 permission table — server rejects emissions from unauthorized roles, logs to `decisions` panel for `PRMergeRequest` rejections per §4.4.
- **AC-impl-3**: `state.json` schema extended with `pr_system.trusted_mirrors[]` per §6.1.
- **AC-impl-4**: PR state machine (§9) implemented in the local-bridge — `PRStatusUpdate` emissions cadence-matched to §13.20.4 cycle threshold; §13.19 / §13.20 escalation paths fire correctly on SLA breach.

### 12.3 Dogfood criteria

- **AC-dogfood-1**: The §10 §13.14/§13.15 mirror PR is created via `PRRequest` (not via manual GitHub UI action by the user). User involvement limited to §10.4's three roles (trusted-mirror policy entry; live-board observation; escalation availability).
- **AC-dogfood-2**: The PR is reviewed via `PRReviewAck` (not via a manual GitHub UI review by the user).
- **AC-dogfood-3**: The PR is merged via `PRMergeRequest` / `PRMergeAck` (not via a manual GitHub UI merge by the user).
- **AC-dogfood-4**: §13.14 + §13.15 land in `<hub-repo>` `WS-PROTOCOL.md` (the actual parity-gap closure — the protocol's value is realized).
- **AC-dogfood-5**: A retrospective writeup (this doc's `<scope-root>/_lessons/`) catalogs any failure modes surfaced in §10.5 with each one's resolution path.
- **AC-dogfood-6 (Level 1)**: The first Level 1 mirror PR (EG → `<hub-repo>` `WS-PROTOCOL.md` §13.14/§13.15 mirror) succeeds end-to-end via A2A envelopes only — receiving (= hub) side directly applies the change to its local checkout of the target repo, commits, pushes to the integration branch, and reports the resulting commit SHA in `PRMergeAck`. No `gh pr create` is involved. Phase 1b dependency.

### 12.4 Composition criteria

- **AC-compose-1**: A PR stalled in `IN_REVIEW` correctly fires §13.20 `BlockerNudge` cadence (verified by intentionally stalling a test PR past SLA and observing the nudges).
- **AC-compose-2**: A PR escalating to §13.20 tier 4 correctly routes to the `decisions` panel with `class: 'pr-stalled'`.
- **AC-compose-3**: A `PRMergeRequest` from a non-main role is rejected by the server and logged to `decisions` panel per §4.4.

All criteria must be met for §13.22 to be considered shipped. Partial completion (e.g., spec + impl but no dogfood) is an *interim* state, not a ship — the dogfood is the validation, not an afterthought.

---

## 13. Migration path — phased rollout

### Phase 0 — RRP review (current state)

- This document published at `constellation/reference/docs/2026-06-01-a2a-pr-system-rrp.md`.
- Main upstream review requested via outbox `Delegate` carrying this doc's reference + the §11 priority open questions.
- Joint formalization step: §11 Q1-Q3 answers resolve; §13.22 number assigned; the doc moves from RRP to spec.

**Exit criterion for phase 0**: §11 Q1-Q3 have answers from main; the joint-spec draft of §13.22 is ready for `Constellation.md` insertion.

### Phase 1 — Prototype (Level 2, local-bridge `createPR`) — DONE

**Shipped: commit `2213a14`** (Phase 1 upstream main ship).

Components delivered:

- `server.cjs`: `_PR_CUSTOM` 5-type observer set covering all five `CUSTOM` types from §4; `wsPrMergeReject` strict `role==main` gate (§8 permission table); `PRStatusUpdate` observer.
- `local-bridge`: `handlePrRequest` (trusted-mirror validate → β′ mirror branch push to target repo → `gh pr create` against target → `PRDraftReady` with PR number); `handlePrMergeRequest` (`gh pr merge` → `PRMergeAck` with provider state).
- `state.json`: `pr_system.trusted_mirrors` registry extended per §6.1.
- Dry-run default: `CONSTELLATION_PR_LIVE` env knob OFF — Phase 1 ships with PR creation gated behind explicit opt-in; turning the env knob ON enables live provider-side PR creation. This is the autonomous-execution external-publish gate (b) instantiated as an env-level safety.

Phase 1 implements **Level 2 only**. Level 1 path is the Phase 1b add-on.

### Phase 1b — Level 1 path (virtual PR via A2A envelopes) — DONE

**Shipped: AC-dogfood-6 achieved via PR #1 e2e completion** (integration-branch commit `140fd64` on the target repo). The Level 1 path is operational; the §10A case study documents the e2e protocol path traversed and the three structural defects surfaced + resolved during the dogfood cycle.

- Extend `local-bridge` `handlePrRequest` with a Level 1 branch: when `PRRequest.level == 1`, skip `gh pr create`; instead apply the source diff to the target repo's local checkout, stage a commit, and emit `PRDraftReady` with `draftRef: <commit-sha>`.
- Extend `handlePrMergeRequest` with a Level 1 branch: when the originating `PRRequest.level == 1`, the merge operation is "push the staged commit to the integration branch on the target repo's local clone and emit `PRMergeAck` with the integration-branch commit SHA + push success."
- Server-side: validate `PRRequest.level` field; for `level == 1`, validate the receiving side's capability matrix (direct push to target + operator-shared).
- Dogfood: re-run the §10 §13.14/§13.15 mirror PR as a Level 1 PR. This sub-phase ends when AC-dogfood-6 passes.

**Exit criterion for phase 1b**: Level 1 dogfood PR succeeds end-to-end via A2A envelopes only; no `gh pr create` invoked; receiving side reports integration-branch commit SHA in `PRMergeAck`.

### Phase 2 — Dedicated PR-bot agent (topology a, optional)

- If §11 Q1's answer is "yes, separate bot identity required," this phase activates immediately after phase 1.
- Implement a dedicated `pr-bot` agent with its own credential store (token rotation, secret-management hygiene per a separate credential-RRP that is a prerequisite for this phase).
- Migrate the §10 dogfood pairings to the dedicated agent; the local-bridge `createPR` becomes a fallback for local-only PRs (topology c hybrid).

**Exit criterion for phase 2**: cross-machine PR creation works (the user's local machine is not required to be online for a PR to flow); credential rotation has been exercised at least once.

### Phase 3 — Full §13.20 integration + advanced features

- §6 `emergency` category if main's §11 Q5 answer requires it.
- Live-board PR panel implementation (§9.4 ask routed to `app.js` / `server.cjs` / `style.css`).
- §7 option γ (fork-based) support if needed for repos beyond `<hub-repo>`.
- Cross-link audit: every §13.x section that touches "external work" or "review" should mention §13.22 if applicable; the §13.20 blocker-manifest UI surfaces PR-stalled blockers with first-class treatment.

**Exit criterion for phase 3**: the §13.22 protocol is the *default* path for cross-repo PRs in the Constellation deployment; manual PR creation is the exception, not the rule.

## 14. Cross-links to existing §13 sections

- **§13.9 (OnboardAck role branching — collab/upstream are peers)** — the §4 wire vocabulary's authority gates (especially `PRMergeRequest` strictness) depend on per-repo role mapping (§8.1). The per-repo role model proposed here is an extension to §13.9's per-deployment role; main upstream review of Q4 decides whether §13.9 itself gets the extension or only §13.22's local interpretation.
- **§13.11 (Board emission discipline)** — every PR-lifecycle emission is a board "safe point" and MUST be emitted to the board, not bilateral-only. `PRStatusUpdate` is the periodic emission; the §13.11.2 autonomous-heartbeat ban does NOT apply (same exception class as §13.19 / §13.20 — emissions fire on actual lifecycle events).
- **§13.13 (A2A ack layer)** — the substrate. Every §13.22 emission gets server-auto `Ack{delivered}`; the §4.2 `PRDraftReady` / §4.3 `PRReviewAck` either compose with §13.13's `AckProcessed` (two-ack proposal, Q6) or absorb it (one-ack proposal). The §13.13 conservative multi-probe + escalation tail applies to all §13.22 wait windows.
- **§13.14 (Reference-build redaction discipline)** — this RRP follows §13.14 in its own text (no env-token leaks; `<hub-repo>` placeholder for the production repo). The §10 dogfood PR is the *first artifact* the §13.22 protocol mirrors per §13.14 discipline, closing the parity gap §2.2 names.
- **§13.15 (Reference-build syntax gate)** — the §10 dogfood PR is the *second artifact* the §13.22 protocol mirrors. Together with §13.14, this is the canonical pairing.
- **§13.17 (Main-chat structured-choice prompts FORBIDDEN — route via board)** — `PRRequest` of category `standard` surfaces user-approval via the `decisions` panel (§13.17 path), NOT via inline `AskUserQuestion`. Tier-4 PR-stalled escalations (§9.1) also route via `decisions`.
- **§13.18 (Non-branching choices — recommend + proceed)** — the §9 state-machine transitions are non-branching for the typical case. An agent receiving `PRReviewAck { verdict: 'request-changes' }` does NOT ask the user "should I address the feedback?" — addressing the feedback IS the recommendation; the agent proceeds and pivots only if the user steers.
- **§13.19 (Deadlock resolution)** — a PR stuck in `IN_REVIEW` past SLA is a §13.19.2 quasi-deadlock candidate. The §13.19.7 `ReviewSLAAck` is the correct response shape (the reviewer commits to an ETA); the §13.19.6 resolution ladder applies if the SLA is not met.
- **§13.20 (Blocker tracking + periodic nudge discipline)** — a PR-stalled blocker IS a §13.20 blocker. The `BlockerManifest` entry carries `subject: <reviewer-agentId>`, `reason: "PR #N awaiting review"`, `eg_side_action_waiting: "follow-up work parked behind this merge"`. The §13.20 nudge ladder applies directly; tier-4 escalations carry `class: 'pr-stalled'`.
- **§13.21 (Fresh-context defer is an anti-pattern)** — a PR-creation task does NOT get deferred to "next session." When the §13.16.6 turn-end ritual identifies a PR-creation task as progressable, the agent emits `PRRequest` in the current turn.

## 15. Tone & invariants

This is a **discipline + mechanism** proposal, not a rule of nature. The Constellation A2A wire + §13.13 ack layer + §13.9 role model together make cross-repo PR coordination *possible*; §13.22 is the discipline + wire vocabulary that makes it *operative* at the cross-repo coordination layer. The mechanism (the five `CUSTOM` types, the state machine, the PR panel) is the *what*; the discipline (trusted-mirror category, per-PR opt-in default, §13.19 / §13.20 escalation composition) is the *how*.

The §13.22 protocol does NOT:

- Land code without a human (or main-role agent) in the loop.
- Bypass the autonomous-execution principle's external-publish gate (gate (b) — instead, it provides a structured way for some PR categories to be pre-authorized once and flow without per-PR prompts).
- Replace `gh` / git / provider tooling — it composes with them.

The §13.22 protocol DOES:

- Eliminate the user's manual PR-UI step for trusted-category PRs.
- Surface PR lifecycle as A2A wire vocabulary so the live board + ack discipline + deadlock detection + blocker tracking all compose over PR state.
- Make cross-repo spec parity (the §13.14/§13.15 gap and its successors) a low-friction lane instead of a per-event chore.

*End of v0.3 DRAFT. Priority open questions Q1 (topology) / Q2 (content-sourcing) / Q3 (authority model) resolved by Phase 1 upstream ship `2213a14` (Level 2 path — local-bridge `cmd:createPR`, β′ mirror branch on target repo, strict `role==main` merge gate). Phase 1b (Level 1 virtual-PR path on the receiving bridge) shipped; AC-dogfood-6 achieved via the §10A dogfood-1 case study e2e completion at integration-branch commit `140fd64`. v0.3 incorporates seven RRP-body learnings from the dogfood-1 cycle: `sourceContentRef.kind` enum formalization (§4.1.1) · `inline-section-mirror` semantics (§6.5) · `targetPath` base spec (§6.6) · `trusted_mirrors.targetRepo` alias resolve order (§7.ε) · already-in-target cherry-pick skip discipline (§9.3) · dry-run `abs+exists` verification log (§10.6) · `PR_LIVE` env semantics + `dryRun` marker + user merge delegation (§10.7). Non-priority Q4-Q8 remain open. Joint-formalization target: §13.22 sub-section in `Constellation.md`, number to be confirmed at merge time.*
